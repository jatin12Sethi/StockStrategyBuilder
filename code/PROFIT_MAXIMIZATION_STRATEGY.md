- SELL 24,000 CE (current week) @ ₹200
- BUY 24,000 CE (next week) @ ₹280

Net Debit: ₹80 × 50 = ₹4,000

```

## 🛡️ RISK MANAGEMENT (Non-Negotiable Rules)

### **Position Sizing Formula**

```
Position Size = (Account Size × Risk per Trade) / (Entry Price - Stop Loss)

Example:
- Account: ₹1,00,000
- Risk per Trade: 2% = ₹2,000
- Entry: ₹150, Stop: ₹90 (₹60 risk per option)
- Max Quantity: ₹2,000 / ₹60 = 33 options (33/50 = 0.66 lots)
→ Trade 1 lot maximum
```

### **Daily Risk Limits**

1. **Maximum 3 trades per day** (avoid overtrading)
2. **Daily loss limit: 6% of account** (stop trading if hit)
3. **Never risk more than 30% of capital** in open positions
4. **No averaging down** in losing positions
5. **No trading in last 15 minutes** (avoid volatility)

### **Stop Loss Execution**

| Strategy Type | Stop Loss | When to Exit |
|--------------|-----------|--------------|
| Bull/Bear Spreads | 40% of debit | Immediately if hit |
| Iron Condors | 100% of credit | OR if price breaks range |
| Long Options | 50% of premium | No exceptions |
| Calendar Spreads | 50% of debit | OR 2% move away |

## 📈 PROFIT BOOKING STRATEGY

### **The 40-60-80 Rule**

1. **40% Profit:** Book 30% of position
2. **60% Profit:** Book another 30%, move SL to breakeven
3. **80% Profit:** Book 30%, let 10% run with trailing SL

**Example:**
```
Entered with 2 lots @ ₹5,000 each (₹10,000 total)
Current value: ₹14,000 (40% profit)

Action:
- Sell 1 lot → Lock ₹2,000 profit
- Keep 1 lot with SL at entry (₹5,000)
- Target: ₹8,000 on remaining lot
```

### **Trailing Stop Loss (for trending trades)**

Once in profit:
1. **+40% profit:** Move SL to breakeven
2. **+70% profit:** Trail SL to +40% profit level
3. **+100% profit:** Trail SL to +60% profit level

## 💡 ADVANCED PROFIT MAXIMIZATION TECHNIQUES

### **1. Pyramiding Winners (Scale In)**

Only add to WINNING positions:

```
Entry: 1 lot Bull Call Spread @ ₹5,000
Price moves up, profit = +30%

Action: Add 1 more lot at new level
Total: 2 lots, average ₹5,750 per lot

Rules:
- Only add if profit > 25%
- Max 2 additions
- Never add to losers
```

### **2. Rolling Options (Extend Profits)**

If position is winning but time running out:

```
Current: 24,000 CE (expires this week) @ ₹300 (bought @ ₹150)
Action: Sell 24,000 CE @ ₹300, Buy 24,100 CE (next week) @ ₹180

Result:
- Lock ₹150 profit
- New position with fresh time
- Higher strike (more room to run)
```

### **3. Hedging Winners (Lock Profits)**

Once in 50%+ profit:

```
Long 24,000 CE @ ₹150, now @ ₹250 (₹5,000 profit)
Action: Sell 24,200 CE @ ₹120

Result:
- Convert to Bull Call Spread
- Lock minimum ₹3,800 profit
- Keep upside potential of ₹4,200
```

### **4. Opposite Side Scalping**

During range-bound days:

```
Morning: Bull Call Spread (upside bet)
→ Profit +50% by 12 PM → Close

Afternoon: Bear Put Spread (downside bet)
→ Profit +40% by 2:30 PM → Close

Result: 2 wins in 1 day (both sides)
```
